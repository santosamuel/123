<h2>1. I would like to offer you a movie watch together, online ofc, I insist you to do this with me</h2>
<h2>2. If for whatever reason you reject my offer, you have an option to watch a movie with me later in Bandung, in the theaters ofc</h2>
<h2>3. If you somehow reject my second offer, I guess I just have to pursue you until you feel guilty of my incredible kindness</h2>
<h2>What would it be? option 1, 2 or 3</h2>
